# Scripts
This folder is for your Node project.

## Package Manager
This project is using Yarn as the package Manager. (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/ )

In most online examples you will see NPM being very common, but this isn't optimized. Yarn is faster in most things.

## Yarn Basic Commands (vs Npm)
- yarn add: adds a package to use in your current package.
- yarn init: initializes the development of a package.
- yarn install: installs all the dependencies defined in a package.json file.
- yarn publish: publishes a package to a package manager.
- yarn remove: removes an unused package from your current package.
